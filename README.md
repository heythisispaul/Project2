                    <p> Before continuing to the main page, please read the simple rules and controls.</p>
                    <p>The game is designed to run on two devices. One devices will display the Main Display - which acts as the main reference board and where gameplay is tracked. This should be displayed prominently for all players to see.</p>
                        <p>The second device will be controlled and only viewed by the game host. The game host will use this screen to view answers, and decide what question to display next. The controls and rules for the game are simple:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reveal an answer by clicking it on the screen, or by pressing it's corresponding number on the keyboard.</li>
                        <li>When a team guesses incorrectly, pressing "Spacebar" assigns the guessing team a strike.</li>
                        <li>Display the next question by pressing "Random Question" or entering the question ID of the question you'd like to display.</li>
                        <li>The game was designed to play with Family Feud rules. If you need a refresher, please read up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Feud#Gameplay">here.</a></li>
                        <li>House Rules are more than welcome.</li>
